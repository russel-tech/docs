Please specify check_types explicitly.\n  \nCustom:\n  - By arrangement with Frankie you can define your own KYC check type.\n  \n  This will allow you to set the minimum number of matches for:\n    - name \n    - date of birth\n    - address\n    - government id\n  \n  This allows for alternatives to the \"standard\" two_plus or one_plus (note, these can be overridden too).\n  \nProfile:\n  - \"profile\": By arrangement with Frankie you can have a \"profile\" check type that applies checks according to a profile that you assign to the entity from a predefined set of profiles.\n  \n  The profile to use will be taken from the entity.entityProfile field if set, or be run through a set of configurable rules to determine which one to use.\n  \n  Profiles act a little like the Pre-defined combinations above in that they can map to a defined list. But they offer a lot more besides, including rules for determining default settings, inbuild data aging and other configurable features.\n  They also allow for a new result set top be returned that provides a more detailed and useful breakdown of the check/verification process.\n  \n  Entity Profiles are the future of checks with Frankie Financial.\n",

Choose one from the available options\n  - ID Check (If you want this)\n  - PEP Checks (again if you want this, choose one of the options)\n\nEntity Checks - One of:\n  - \"one_plus\": Checks name, address and DoB against a minimum of 1 data source. (also known as a 1+1)\n  - \"two_plus\": Checks name, address and DoB against a minimum of 2 independent data sources (also known as a 2+2)\n\nID Checks - One of:\n  - \"id\": Checks all of the identity documents, but not necessarily the entity itself independently. Use this in conjunction with a one_plus or two_plus for more.\n  \nFraud Checks - One or more  of:\n  - \"fraudlist\": Checks to see if the identity appears on any known fraud lists. Should be run after KYC/ID checks have passed.\n  - \"fraudid\": Checks external ID services to see if details appear in fraud detection services (e.g. EmailAge or FraudNet)\n  \nPEP Checks - One of:\n  - \"pep\": Will only run PEP/Sanctions checks (no identity verification)\n  - \"pep_media\": Will run PEP/Sanctions checks, as well as watchlist and adverse media checks. (no identity verification)\n  \n  * NOTE: These checks will ONLY run if either the KYC/ID checks have been run prior, or it is the only check requested.\n\nPre-defined combinations (deprecated):\n  - \"full\": equivalent to \"two_plus,id,pep_media\" or \"pep_media\" if the target is an organisation.\n  - \"default\": Currently defined as \"two_plus,id\" or \"pep\" if the target is an organisation.\n\n  * NOTE: These options are now deprecated and support for these options will be eventually halted. Please specify check_types explicitly.\n  \nCustom:\n  - By arrangement with Frankie you can define your own KYC check type.\n  \n  This will allow you to set the minimum number of matches for:\n    - name \n    - date of birth\n    - address\n    - government id\n  \n  This allows for alternatives to the \"standard\" two_plus or one_plus (note, these can be overridden too).\n  \nProfile:\n  - \"profile\": By arrangement with Frankie you can have a \"profile\" check type that applies checks according to a profile that you assign to the entity from a predefined set of profiles.\n  \n  The profile to use will be taken from the entity.entityProfile field if set, or be run through a set of configurable rules to determine which one to use.\n  \n  Profiles act a little like the Pre-defined combinations above in that they can map to a defined list. But they offer a lot more besides, including rules for determining default settings, inbuild data aging and other configurable features.\n  They also allow for a new result set top be returned that provides a more detailed and useful breakdown of the check/verification process.\n  \n  Entity Profiles are the future of checks with Frankie Financial.\n",

But they offer a lot more besides, including rules for determining default settings, inbuilt data aging and other configurable features.\n  They also allow for a new result set top be returned that provides a more detailed and useful breakdown of the check/verification process.\n  \n  Entity Profiles are a recent feature (since v1.4.0) but are now the default checkType to use with Frankie Financial.\n\n**Individual Check Types**\n\nWhilst we strongly recommend the use of the \"profile\" checktype, it does map to any combination of the types below.

(also known as a 1+1)\n  - \"two_plus\": Checks name, address and DoB against a minimum of 2 independent data sources (also known as a 2+2)\n\nID Checks - One of:\n  - \"id\": Checks all of the identity documents, but not necessarily the entity itself independently. Use this in conjunction with a one_plus or two_plus for more.\n  - \"visa\":\n  \nID Validate - One of:\n  - \"idvalidate\": Checks to see if photo ID has had OCR scanning, ID document validation and photo comparison run against it. Can be used in conjunction with any of the KYC/ID/AML checks.\n  \nManual Check:\n  - \"manual\": (mKYC) Checks user has a sufficient amount of operator verified ID and will then \"pass\" all Entity and ID related checks.\n  \nFraud Checks - One or more of:\n  - \"fraudlist\": Checks to see if the identity appears on any known fraud lists. Should be run after KYC/ID checks have passed.\n  - \"fraudcheck\": Checks external ID services to see if details appear in fraud detection services (e.g. EmailAge or FraudNet)\n  \nPEP Checks - One of:\n  - \"pep\": Will only run PEP/Sanctions checks (no identity verification)\n  - \"pep_media\": Will run PEP/Sanctions checks, as well as watchlist and adverse media checks. (no identity verification)\n  \n  * NOTE: These checks will ONLY run if either the KYC/ID checks have been run prior, or it is the only check requested.\n\nDevice checks:\n  - \"device\": This will allow you to pass in device details captured through services like ThreatMetrix or Sardine.ai\n\nCustom:\n  - By arrangement with Frankie you can define your own KYC check type.\n  \n  This will allow you to set the minimum number of matches for:\n    - name \n    - date of birth\n    - address\n    - government id\n  \n  This allows for alternatives to the \"standard\" two_plus or one_plus (note, these can be overridden too). \n  Speak with the Customer Success team when you're onboarding.\n",

The image is also OCR'd and the OCR results are compared against the data entered for any KYC checks to make sure that it is the same document.\n\n>- Facial Photo Comparison - Compares the portrait picture of the identity document, to the “selfie” taken as part of the idv process. The selfie can be either a still photo or a live video (preferred). This checks both that the selfie taken is valid and not manipulated, and that it is a reasonable match to the picture on the identity document. The exact algorithm to determine matches and quality is dependant on the provider chosen.\n\n>- Facial Duplicate - Compares the selfie provided with previous selfies for other applicants. This check type is trying to identify based on the selfie whether this applicant has already registered under a different name and potentially with faked identification.

The order of the requested checks is not important, they will be re-ordered by the service and in some cases, depending on your account configuration, may be skipped.\n\n  The validation that is performed on the requested checks is to:\n  - ensure the check type is known\n  - is suitable for the type of entity (no KYC for organisations)\n  - disallow manual (mKYC) check with any other kind of KYC\n  - disallow mixing the \"profile\" check with any other kind of check.\n\nThe supported check types are:\n\nProfile:\n  - \"profile\": By arrangement with Frankie we will create a \"profile\" check type that applies checks according to a recipe that you assign to the entity from a predefined set of profiles.\n  \n  The profile to use will be taken from the entity.entityProfile field if set, or be run through a set of configurable rules to determine which one to use.\n  \n  Profiles provide a pre-defined combination of individual checkTypes (see the list below). But they offer a lot more besides, including rules for determining default settings, inbuilt data aging and other configurable features.\n  They also allow for a new result set top be returned that provides a more detailed and useful breakdown of the check/verification process.\n  \n  Entity Profiles are a recent feature (since v1.4.0) but are now the default checkType to use with Frankie Financial.\n\n**Individual Check Types**\n\nWhilst we strongly recommend the use of the \"profile\" checktype, it does map to any combination of the types below. If you wish to use these individually, please contact developer support for more details on how to use these effectively.\n\nEntity Checks - One of:\n  - \"one_plus\": Checks name, address and DoB against a minimum of 1 data source. (also known as a 1+1)\n  - \"two_plus\": Checks name, address and DoB against a minimum of 2 independent data sources (also known as a 2+2)\n\nID Checks - One of:\n  - \"id\": Checks all of the identity documents, but not necessarily the entity itself independently. Use this in conjunction with a one_plus or two_plus for more.\n  - \"visa\":\n  \nID Validate - One of:\n  - \"idvalidate\": Checks to see if photo ID has had OCR scanning, ID document validation and photo comparison run against it. Can be used in conjunction with any of the KYC/ID/AML checks.\n  \nManual Check:\n  - \"manual\": (mKYC) Checks user has a sufficient amount of operator verified ID and will then \"pass\" all Entity and ID related checks.\n  \nFraud Checks - One or more of:\n  - \"fraudlist\": Checks to see if the identity appears on any known fraud lists. Should be run after KYC/ID checks have passed.\n  - \"fraudcheck\": Checks external ID services to see if details appear in fraud detection services (e.g. EmailAge or FraudNet)\n  \nPEP Checks - One of:\n  - \"pep\": Will only run PEP/Sanctions checks (no identity verification)\n  - \"pep_media\": Will run PEP/Sanctions checks, as well as watchlist and adverse media checks. (no identity verification)\n  \n  * NOTE: These checks will ONLY run if either the KYC/ID checks have been run prior, or it is the only check requested.\n\nDevice checks:\n  - \"device\": This will allow you to pass in device details captured through services like ThreatMetrix or Sardine.ai\n\nCustom:\n  - By arrangement with Frankie you can define your own KYC check type.\n  \n  This will allow you to set the minimum number of matches for:\n    - name \n    - date of birth\n    - address\n    - government id\n  \n  This allows for alternatives to the \"standard\" two_plus or one_plus (note, these can be overridden too). \n  Speak with the Customer Success team when you're onboarding.\n",

(also known as a 1+1)\n  - \"two_plus\": Checks name, address and DoB against a minimum of 2 independent data sources (also known as a 2+2)\n\nID Checks - One of:\n  - \"id\": Checks all of the identity documents, but not necessarily the entity itself independently. Use this in conjunction with a one_plus or two_plus for more.\n  \nFraud Checks - One or more  of:\n  - \"fraudlist\": Checks to see if the identity appears on any known fraud lists. Should be run after KYC/ID checks have passed.\n  - \"fraudid\": Checks external ID services to see if details appear in fraud detection services (e.g. EmailAge or FraudNet)\n  \nPEP Checks - One of:\n  - \"pep\": Will only run PEP/Sanctions checks (no identity verification)\n  - \"pep_media\": Will run PEP/Sanctions checks, as well as watchlist and adverse media checks. (no identity verification)\n  \n  * NOTE: These checks will ONLY run if either the KYC/ID checks have been run prior, or it is the only check requested.\n\nPre-defined combinations (deprecated):\n  - \"full\": equivalent to \"two_plus,id,pep_media\" or \"pep_media\" if the target is an organisation.\n  - \"default\": Currently defined as \"two_plus,id\" or \"pep\" if the target is an organisation.\n\n  * NOTE: These options are now deprecated and support for these options will be eventually halted.

But they offer a lot more besides, including rules for determining default settings, inbuild data aging and other configurable features.\n  They also allow for a new result set top be returned that provides a more detailed and useful breakdown of the check/verification process.\n  \n  Entity Profiles are the future of checks with Frankie Financial.\n",

        "description": "When creating a new check, you need to define the checks you wish to run.\n  \nThe checkType is make up of a comma separated list of the types of check you wish to run. The order of the requested checks is not important, they will be re-ordered by the service and in some cases, depending on your account configuration, may be skipped.\n\n  The validation that is performed on the requested checks is to:\n  - ensure the check type is known\n  - is suitable for the type of entity (no KYC for organisations)\n  - disallow manual (mKYC) check with any other kind of KYC\n  - disallow mixing the \"profile\" check with any other kind of check.\n\nThe supported check types are:\n\nProfile:\n  - \"profile\": By arrangement with Frankie we will create a \"profile\" check type that applies checks according to a recipe that you assign to the entity from a predefined set of profiles.\n  \n  The profile to use will be taken from the entity.entityProfile field if set, or be run through a set of configurable rules to determine which one to use.\n  \n  Profiles provide a pre-defined combination of individual checkTypes (see the list below). But they offer a lot more besides, including rules for determining default settings, inbuilt data aging and other configurable features.\n  They also allow for a new result set top be returned that provides a more detailed and useful breakdown of the check/verification process.\n  \n  Entity Profiles are a recent feature (since v1.4.0) but are now the default checkType to use with Frankie Financial.\n\n**Individual Check Types**\n\nWhilst we strongly recommend the use of the \"profile\" checktype, it does map to any combination of the types below. If you wish to use these individually, please contact developer support for more details on how to use these effectively.\n\nEntity Checks - One of:\n  - \"one_plus\": Checks name, address and DoB against a minimum of 1 data source. (also known as a 1+1)\n  - \"two_plus\": Checks name, address and DoB against a minimum of 2 independent data sources (also known as a 2+2)\n\nID Checks - One of:\n  - \"id\": Checks all of the identity documents, but not necessarily the entity itself independently. Use this in conjunction with a one_plus or two_plus for more.\n  - \"visa\":\n  \nID Validate - One of:\n  - \"idvalidate\": Checks to see if photo ID has had OCR scanning, ID document validation and photo comparison run against it. Can be used in conjunction with any of the KYC/ID/AML checks.\n  \nManual Check:\n  - \"manual\": (mKYC) Checks user has a sufficient amount of operator verified ID and will then \"pass\" all Entity and ID related checks.\n  \nFraud Checks - One or more of:\n  - \"fraudlist\": Checks to see if the identity appears on any known fraud lists. Should be run after KYC/ID checks have passed.\n  - \"fraudcheck\": Checks external ID services to see if details appear in fraud detection services (e.g. EmailAge or FraudNet)\n  \nPEP Checks - One of:\n  - \"pep\": Will only run PEP/Sanctions checks (no identity verification)\n  - \"pep_media\": Will run PEP/Sanctions checks, as well as watchlist and adverse media checks. (no identity verification)\n  \n  * NOTE: These checks will ONLY run if either the KYC/ID checks have been run prior, or it is the only check requested.\n\nDevice checks:\n  - \"device\": This will allow you to pass in device details captured through services like ThreatMetrix or Sardine.ai\n\nCustom:\n  - By arrangement with Frankie you can define your own KYC check type.\n  \n  This will allow you to set the minimum number of matches for:\n    - name \n    - date of birth\n    - address\n    - government id\n  \n  This allows for alternatives to the \"standard\" two_plus or one_plus (note, these can be overridden too). \n  Speak with the Customer Success team when you're onboarding.\n",
